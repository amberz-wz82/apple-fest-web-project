# Project 1: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


## Existing Design, Planning, & Refined Design (Milestone 1)

### Existing Site: The Site (Milestone 1)
> What is your existing site about? Tell us about it.

TODO (Do not write your answer with a > before it. Otherwise your answer and the question render in the same massive paragraph in markdown preview making it insanely difficult to grade. Please be nice to your graders and make sure your answers don't render on the same line as the question in Markdown Preview. Please delete this text.)

> How and where did you create this site?

TODO

> Is this site designed for desktop, mobile devices or both?

TODO


### Existing Site: Audience (Milestone 1)
> Who is your _existing_ site's audience?
> Briefly explain who the intended audience(s) is for your website. Be specific and justify why this audience is appropriate for your site. Remember, you may not be the audience.

TODO


### Existing Site: Audience Needs (Milestone 1)
> Document your existing site's audience's needs. (These should be informed by user research. Not assumptions.)
> List each need below. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.
> You may copy these from your previous project. However, I would encourage you to refine them.

Need/Want 1: TODO: Brief Title
- **Needs and Wants** _What does your client and audience need and want?_
  - TODO
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those needs and wants?_
  - TODO
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - TODO

Need/Want 2: TODO
TODO

Need/Want 3: TODO
TODO

etc.


### Existing Site: Design/Sketches (Milestone 1)
> Sketch your existing site. Include these sketches here.
> DO NOT COPY SKETCHES FROM THE ORIGINAL ASSIGNMENT!
> Create new sketches here. This is part of the design process to get you thinking about the strengths/weaknesses of the current design.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch.

TODO
(Don't know how to "link" images, review the Markdown documentation. Delete this text.)


### Refined Site: Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the needs your identified above from user research, to develop a persona of your site's audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a "depiction". This can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> There is no required format for the persona.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona. Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.

Persona's Name: TODO

TODO (the rest of the persona)


### Refined Site: Content Organization/Navigation (Milestone 1)
> Identify the content that is necessary for your persona. **Refer to the persona by name.**
> List the content here. Label the content as "(new)" if it's new to the existing site.
> **Don't forget to include the form.**

- (Example) Cornell Admissions Process (delete this line)
- (Example) Cornell Admission Stats (new) (delete this line)
- TODO
- TODO
- ...


> Organize the content for the audience and identify possible pages for the content using card sorting.
> Document your card sorting by taking a photo and including it here.
> You are **required** to show the alternative organization you considered. (1 card sorting is not enough)

TODO


> Explain your thought process behind the card sorting. **Refer to the persona by name in your explanation.**

TODO


> Lastly, list the pages that resulted from your final card sort (i.e. your site's navigation) and content for each page.

- (Example) Home (delete these example lines)
  - (Example) List of colleges
  - (Example) New research
- (Example) Admissions
  - (Example) admissions criteria
- TODO
- TODO
- ...


### Refined Site: Design (Milestone 1)
> Refine the design of your site to meet the needs of your users using your persona.
> Include sketches of each page of the refined design.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch.
> Document your _entire_ design process. **Show your preliminary sketches and your final sketches.** **We want to see iteration!**
> Don't forget the form and confirmation page!
> **Refer to your persona by name in each explanation.**

TODO


### Partial Plan (Milestone 1)
> Using your refined sketches, plan your site's partials.
> You may describe each partial or sketch it. It's up to you!

TODO



## Sticky Form (Milestone 2)

### Sticky Form Planning (Milestone 2)
> What controls do you need for your form?

TODO


> Plan out your feedback messages for your form. You may sketch (probably the easiest) or write it out.
> Use your persona. Refer to the persona by name. Explain how the feedback messages are usable for your persona.

TODO


> How does this form meet the needs of your persona?
> Refer to the persona by name.

TODO


### Validation Code Plan (Milestone 2)

```



## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Routing (Final Submission)
> Plan your dynamic HTTP routing.
> List each route and the PHP file for each route.

| Route | PHP File                            |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| /     | pages/home.php (or pages/index.php) |

TODO


### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. You don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.

TODO


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from 1300? What things did you have trouble with?

TODO

### Grading: Mobile or Desktop (Final Submission)
> When we grade your final site, should we grade this with a mobile screen size or a desktop screen size?
