                Downtown Ithaca will welcome a couple farmers to sell their harvest bounty throughout the week in a socially distant, de-densified version of a farmers market and cider trail happening on the Commons and inside downtown shops and restaurants in the district.
            </p>
            <p class="home">
                Shops and restaurants who have safely reopened may feature apple & cider themed menus and gifts for sale too. The collection outlined on a Cider Trail.
            </p>
            <p class="home">
                As part of the Cider Trail experience, participants can share Instagram and Facebook photos throughout the week and enter to win a Downtown Ithaca Gift card when they hashtag their photos with #FeelingAppleFestive & #DowntownIthaca
            </p>
            <p class="home">
                <em>Next Fall, we hope we can return to the Annual Apple Harvest Festival during the last weekend in September 2021, but for now we encourage you all to enjoy apples and apples products safely, responsibly, and socially distant.</em>
